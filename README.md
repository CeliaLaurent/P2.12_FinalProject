# P2.12_FinalProject
The source code used in this project was taken from https://repository.prace-ri.eu/git/CodeVault/training-material/parallel-programming/MPI/-/tree/master/heat-equation. It solves two dimensional heat equation with MPI parallelization. The code features non-blocking point-to-point communication, user defined datatypes, collective communication, and parallel I/O with MPI I/O.

The goal of this project is to use the Intel performance analysis tools to understand how to improve the source code.
Find out what are the bottlenecks

## 1. Application Performance Snapshot 
This tool is part of the Intel VTune Amplifier suite.

## 2. Intel VTune

## 3. Intel Advisor

## 4. Optimize the code
